# Explicitly include important directories
# Cloud Build will respect .gitignore by default
# This file ensures critical build directories are NOT excluded

# DO NOT ignore these patterns (use negation)
# The default behavior already includes tracked files
# This file is mainly a safeguard

# Only explicitly exclude truly unnecessary files for build
